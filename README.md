# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

### - In this analysis the manager is requesting we analyze tables that consist of employees, managers, departments, titles, and salaries to determine who will be retiring soon from the company. I began with an ERD to give me an outline of the project then by using my prowess in SQL I needed to create tables, import/export csv files, and query the data extract the information that was requested.

## RESULTS

### - Pewlett Hackard has 41,000 people that are about to retire.

## SUMMARY

### - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
### Soon Pewlett Hackard will have to make up for the 41,000 employees it is about to lose.
### - Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
### With there being only about 1500 people eligible for the mentorship and a grand total of around 41,000 employees lost, there will not be enough mentors unless they each took around 25 new employees as mentees.
